Keep the three top tabs as-is.

In Play Mode, in the header area where you show “Play Mode / Test new markdown output / Session status”, add:

A “Party” button (or icon + label) on the right:

Example: 👥 Party (4) or Party & Characters.

Clicking opens a right-hand slide-over (or modal) for character management.

A smaller “Add character” icon inside that Party panel (rather than cluttering the main header).

You called it a modal, but a slide-over from the right will feel more “in context” while still behaving like a modal (blocking background interactions).

2.2. Party panel / modal layout

Top of panel

Title: Party for: [Campaign Name]

Subline: “Session: [Session name]”

Button: + Add character

Body: two-column layout within the panel

Left column: character list

Scrollable list of character cards:

Avatar (class icon or image)

Character name

Player name (optional)

HP bar (current / max)

Tag: PC / NPC

Selecting a character focuses it in the right column.

Right column: character detail

Tabs or sections:

Overview (for quick mid-play reference)

HP with +/- buttons

AC, passive Perception, key saves

Main ability modifiers

Conditions (toggle chips)

Resources

Spell slots with tick boxes

Limited features (“Rage 2/3”, “Ki 4/6”)

Notes / History

DM & player notes

Auto-generated timeline of changes this session.

This avoids re-building a full sheet; it’s a “battle dashboard” more than a builder.

2.3. “Add character” flow

When + Add character is clicked, open a sub-modal (or stepper) inside the panel:

Step 1: Source

Radio buttons:

Import from D&D Beyond

Quick NPC

Import from D&D Beyond

For a first iteration:

Field: “Paste your DNDBeyond character URL”

On submit, you:

Extract character ID.

Call your backend to pull down the JSON from DNDBeyond.

Show a confirmation:

Name, class & level, race, background.

Player name (free text).

Checkbox: “Share mechanical details with the AI DM” (important for privacy).

Save as:

Campaign-level character (so it’s reusable in future sessions).

Automatically mark it as “Included in current session”.

Quick NPC

Fields:

Name

Role (tag: ally / enemy / neutral)

HP / AC / key notes

Used for recurring NPCs, hirelings, etc.

2.4. In-chat integrations

To make it feel magic in Play Mode:

Message actions:
When the AI DM says: “The cultist stabs Thalia for 11 piercing damage,” show a little button under that message:

Apply 11 damage to Thalia

Clicking directly updates her HP in the Party panel.

Character chips on messages:
When a player speaks, show a tiny character tag under their name:

“Alice (playing Thalia)”
Hovering that tag displays a mini character tooltip: name, HP bar, AC, passive Perception.

Status pips in the Party button:
If any character is 0 HP, the Party (4) button gets a red dot; if someone has an active condition, maybe a subtle icon.
