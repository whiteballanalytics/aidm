    ### Continuity and Planning Notes
    
    **Continuity Notes:**
    
    - Introduce initial players and NPCs—Sera Duthwhistle, Jast ‘Three‑Nails’ Urve, and Pellin Orrovant.
    - Establish the thematic elements of bureaucracy and neighborhood pettiness as key drivers.
    - Foreshadow the impending neighborhood tensions that escalate into formal confrontations.
    
    **Analysis of Campaign So Far:**
    
    As this is the first session, the players will be introduced to the campaign’s emphasis on municipal disputes and guild politics. The immediate goal is to engage them with both the neighborhood's charm and underlying tensions. They'll encounter the incipient bureaucracy conflict and pieces of evidence that hint at the manipulations orchestrated by Pellin Orrovant.
    
    **Narrative Overview:**
    
    In this opening session, players will investigate the neighborhood issues stemming from the signboard dispute on Delzorin Street. As they engage with local NPCs, they will uncover a web of minor grievances being manipulated by bigger forces. The players participate in an inspection and prepare a variance request, only to be thwarted by Pellin Orrovant’s strategic obstruction.

    ### Opening Read-Aloud
    
    “As the day wanes on Delzorin Street, a deceptive calm lies over the cobblestones, broken only by the rustling of awnings and the distant sound of a watch bell. Amongst the genteel facades, two neighbors stand locked in dispute. The teahouse's new sign—a mere inch over regulation—threatens to topple the fragile peace like a stone into a pond. Gathered around, the neighborhood holds its breath, waiting for a resolution that seems further away with each angry word.”
